Here is the list of everything used in this project:

* 1 - [Table Top Ice Maker](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Frigidaire-26lb-Portable-Countertop-Icemaker-EFIC108-BLUE/748546738?selected=true)
    * Most the brands seem to use the same basic design, so it shouldn't matter too much.
* 1 - 5 Gallon
    *Bucket as Water Reservoir
* 1 - [Arduino Mega](https://www.adafruit.com/product/191)
    * I used this because 1) I had it 2) it has a power jack that made powering the whole thing easy.
* 1 - 12v Wall power plug that fit the Arduino Mega Power Jack.
* 1 - [8 Port Relay Board](https://www.amazon.com/SunFounder-Channel-Shield-Raspberry-Arduino/dp/B00E0NSORY)
    * I linked a 4 port from Amazon.  I had 8 port around from an old firework automation unit I had done years ago.  While it only needs 2 in the current configuration, I plan on adding a heating element for winter, so the extra ports may be helpful.
* 1 - [LCD Screen with AdaFruit USB/Serial Backpack](https://www.adafruit.com/product/782) 
    * Makes it easy to control the screen with 1 pin and simple Serial Protocols.
* 1 - Button
    * I got one scavenged from a toy's packaging (push here for demo) that I used simply because it had a nice housing and connectors.
* 1 - RGB LED
    * This was for fun as I had never used one, and had a bunch, and wanted an excuse to try it.
* 2 - Waterproof DS18B20 Temp Sensors
    * 1 for the reservoir
    * 1 for the cooler itself.
* 3 - 220 ohm resisters for the LED.
* 1 - 4.7k ohm resister for the DS18B20 Sensors.
* 1 - [Disposable Food Storage Container](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Rubbermaid-TakeAlongs-Redesigned-Rectangle-Food-Storage-Container-Set-of-3-4-Cups/16664882) & zip ties
    * I used this to house the finished circuit.  Simple, cheap and easy to put together.  A hobby knife can cut the exact holes you need, right where you need them.  One day I may laser a nice box that looks more professional, but this is home hobby at its best.
